//  1. Write a program that consists of a while-loop that (each time around the loop) reads in two ints and then prints them.
//  Exit the program when a terminating '|' is entered.
//  2. Change the program to write out the smaller value is: followed by the smaller of the numbers and the larger value
//  is: followed by the larger value.
//  3. Augment the program so that it writes the line the numbers are equal (only) if they are equal.
//  4. Change the program so that it uses doubles instead of ints.
